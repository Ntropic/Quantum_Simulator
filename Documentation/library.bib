  title       = {Efficient Simulation of Random Quantum States and Operators},
  abstract    = {We investigate the generation of quantum states and unitary operations that are ``random'' in certain respects. We show how to use such states to estimate the average fidelity, an important measure in the study of implementations of quantum algorithms. We re-discover the result that the states of a maximal set of mutually-unbiased bases serve this purpose. An efficient circuit is presented that generates an arbitrary state out of such a set. Later on, we consider unitary operations that can be used to turn any quantum channel into a depolarizing channel. It was known before that the Clifford group serves this and a related purpose, and we show that these are actually the same. We also show that a small subset of the Clifford group is already sufficient to accomplish this. We conclude with an efficient construction of the elements of that subset. This thesis is based on joint work with Richard Cleve, Joseph Emerson, and Etera Livine.},

  abstract     = {We present a composite pulse controlled phase gate which together with a bus architecture improves the feasibility of a recent quantum computing proposal based on rare-earth-ion doped crystals. Our proposed gate operation is tolerant to variations between ions of coupling strengths, pulse lengths, and frequency shifts, and it achieves worst case fidelities above 0.999 with relative variations in coupling strength as high as 10% and frequency shifts up to several percent of the resonant Rabi frequency of the laser used to implement the gate. We outline an experiment to demonstrate the creation and detection of maximally entangled states in the system.},

  title        = {Efficient error models for fault-tolerant architectures and the Pauli twirling approximation},
  abstract     = {The design and optimization of realistic architectures for fault-tolerant quantum computation requires error models that are both reliable and amenable to large-scale classical simulation. Perhaps the simplest and most practical general-purpose method for constructing such an error model is to twirl a given completely positive channel over the Pauli basis, a procedure we refer to as the Pauli twirling approximation (PTA). In this work we test the accuracy of the PTA for a small stabilizer measurement circuit relevant to fault-tolerant quantum computation, in the presence of both intrinsic gate errors and decoherence, and find excellent agreement over a wide range of physical error rates. The combined simplicity and accuracy of the PTA, along with its direct connection to the chi matrix of process tomography, suggests that it be used as a standard reference point for more refined error model constructions.},
