# Quantum_Simulator
## A matlab based simulator for a gate based quantum computer. 

A short introduction into the main functions of the Quantum Simulator are given in the [Documentation](https://github.com/Ntropic/Quantum_Simulator/blob/master/How_To_Quantum_Simulator.pdf).

The Quantum Simulator represents algorithms as products of unitary matrices, that can be analyzed on their own or as acting onto wavevectors or density matrices. The density matrix approach also allows for noise models to be applied to the density matrix, via Twirling with Krauss operators, corresponding to a noise model, in between the gate operations. 

The Quantum Simulator assumes a fully connected qubit register, and a set of elementary operations, that can be defined by the user. From these elementary gates, composite gates can be defined. Among the functions, there are many ways to represent the data, including the preview of LaTeX documents that can be created in the code.

I will add a detailed description at a later point.
